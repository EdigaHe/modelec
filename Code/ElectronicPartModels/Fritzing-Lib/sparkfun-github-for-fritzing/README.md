Fritzing Parts
==============

This repo houses all of the SFE Fritzing parts for use in diagrams in tutorials. If you create a new part in Fritzing that correlates to an SFE part, please add it here so others may use it and to avoid duplication. Make sure to also check Fritzing software for additional boards.
