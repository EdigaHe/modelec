# README #
NBBJ Design Computation is excited to announce the release of a new plug-in for Grasshopper: Human UI. 

Human UI is a new interface paradigm for Grasshopper. Create professional looking Grasshopper apps with custom user interfaces without writing any code.
As of January 2016, Human UI is now an open source project. It was originally developed at NBBJ by the Design Computation Leadership Team over the course of about 10 months in 2015-2016.

Going well beyond the capabilities of the “remote control panel,” Human UI makes it easier to create a user-facing display for your Grasshopper definition – one that looks and feels like a Windows app – so you can use GH to build tools for other designers or even clients, without exposing the Grasshopper interface at all.

Gone are the days of faking a user interface by laying out sliders and text panels and hiding wires on the Grasshopper canvas. Human UI interfaces are entirely separate from the Grasshopper canvas and leverage the power of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), a graphical subsystem for rendering user interfaces in the Windows environment.

In other words: Human UI makes your GH definition feel like a Windows app. Create tabbed views, dynamic sliders, pulldown menus, checkboxes, and even 3D viewports and web browsers that look great and make sense to anyone--including designers and clients with no understanding of Grasshopper.
